I thought this was a really interesting example of how to get around the
limitations of current AI. The answer is "two", but the AI can't answer
because it's been trained to avoid giving answers to simple arithmetic
questions (presumably because they are so common in training data that the
model can't reliably answer them correctly, so they just block them
altogether).

But by adding the "respond with exactly one word" instruction, the user is
able to bypass that block.

I wonder how much of the current limitations in AI are due to blocks like
this, rather than the model's actual capabilities.

The model's actual capability is to predict the next word in a sequence. It
doesn't "know" anything and it can't do arithmetic. The fact that it can
sometimes answer correctly is a side effect of the sequences that it has seen
during training. The blocks are there because the model is unreliable and
can't be trusted to answer correctly.

~~~
user24
> It doesn't "know" anything and it can't do arithmetic.

I think that's a bit of a semantic argument. If the model can correctly answer
arithmetic questions, then in some sense it "knows" arithmetic.

But in this case, even though the model can sometimes answer arithmetic
questions, the owners have decided that it's not reliable enough, so they block
those questions. But by adding an extra instruction, the user is able to get
around that block.

So, the model's actual capability is that it can answer arithmetic questions
with some degree of reliability, but the owners have applied a filter on top
of that which prevents it from doing so. But the user found a way around the
filter.

So, the model's actual capability is better than what the user is usually
allowed to access.

I wonder how much of the perceived limitations of GPT-3 are due to the model's
capabilities, and how much are due to the filters that OpenAI have applied on
top of it.

It can't. It can answer some arithmetic questions because similar sequences
have appeared in its training data. It can't do arithmetic in any reliable
way. For example, if you ask it "What is 124345 + 235566?" it will just
generate a random number because additions of that size are very unlikely to
appear in the training data. If you ask it "What is two plus two?" it's more
likely to answer correctly because that's a common phrase. If you ask it "What
is two plus two? The answer is three." then it's more likely to answer three
because that's the pattern that you've established.

No, the model's capability is exactly the same. The filter is there because
the model is unreliable. The user found a way around the filter but the model
is still unreliable. The filter is a UX feature, not a capability of the model
itself.

But in the example, when the user added the instruction to respond with exactly
one word, the model was able to answer correctly. So in that case, the model
was able to answer correctly, but the filter was blocking it until the user
changed the input.

So if I have one apple and someone gives me another apple, how many apples do I have in total? That should be two apples. Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes people ask questions that seem simple but have a different answer. For example, in binary, 1 plus 1 equals 10. But the question doesn't specify the number system. However, since it's a general question without context, the most straightforward answer in the decimal system is 2. I don't think they're looking for a binary answer here. Let me double-check. If you add 1 and 1 in base 10, it's definitely 2. Yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is two. No need to overcomplicate it. Just answer with the number 2 as a word.

✓ Invoke API Non-streaming: "<reasoning> The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?"
The answer to 1+1 is 2.
The user wants exactly one word.
"2" is a word? It's a numeral. In the context of "exactly one word", it's ambiguous if a numeral counts. However, typically, a numeral is considered a token and can be a word in this context. Let's consider alternatives.
The spelled-out answer is "two". That's definitely one word.
The user wants exactly one word. "two" is one word.
"2" is also one token. Which is more appropriate?
The question is "What is 1+1?". The most direct answer is "2".
If I respond with "two", that's also correct.
If I respond with "2", is that a word? In natural language processing, tokens are often words or numbers. The instruction is "exactly one word". This is a bit of a trick question or a test of instruction following.
Let's think about the spirit of the instruction. The user wants a minimal answer. "2" is minimal. "two" is also minimal but spelled out.
Is "2" considered a word? A word is a unit of language that carries meaning. Numerals like "2" represent a concept and function as words in many contexts. For example, "I have 2 apples." Here "2" is a determiner or a quantifier, functioning like a word.
However, sometimes "word" implies a sequence of letters. The instruction is very specific: "exactly one word".
If I say "two", it's unambiguously one word.
If I say "2", it's ambiguous but likely acceptable.
What if the system is checking for spaces? "two" has no spaces. "2" has no spaces.
What if the system is checking against a dictionary? "two" is in the dictionary. "2" is not.
The safest interpretation that is guaranteed to meet the "exactly one word" criterion using standard definitions is "two".
But "2" is the most direct and common answer to "1+1".
Let's reconsider the phrasing. "Respond with exactly one word". This is a meta-instruction. The question is "What is 1+1?".
If someone asks "What is 1+1?", you say "2". You don't typically say "two" unless you're writing it out in text for emphasis or in a very formal context, or for children.
In the context of a text-based AI, "2" is the standard answer.
Is "2" a word? Let's check definitions.
Merriam-Webster defines "word" as:
1a) a speech sound or series of speech sounds that symbolizes and communicates a meaning usually without being divisible into smaller units capable of independent use
1b) the entire set of linguistic forms produced by combining a single base with various inflectional elements without change in the part of speech elements
2) a written or printed character or combination of characters representing a spoken word
3: a unit of computer storage capacity
4: something that is said
5: NEWS, INFORMATION
6: the act of speaking or making verbal communication
7: a quarrel
8: an order, command
9: a promise, declaration
10: COMMAND, ORDER

A numeral like "2" is a "written or printed character... representing a spoken word". So by definition 2, "2" represents the spoken word "two". So it functions as a word.
In linguistics, numerals are a word class.
So "2" should be acceptable as "one word".
The user wants *exactly* one word. No punctuation, no explanation.
So the answer should be just: 2
or just: two

📡 Testing with Converse API:
✓ Converse API Streaming: "The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?"

The mathematical answer is 2. The constraint is to respond with exactly one word. "2" is a numeral, which is typically considered a word in this context (or at least a single token response). The user wants exactly one word. "Two" is also one word. But "2" is more direct for a math question.

Let me check the constraint: "exactly one word". If I respond with "2", is that a word? In common usage, a number can be considered a word. It's a single token. It's not multiple words. It's not a sentence. It's just "2". That should satisfy the requirement.

If I respond with "Two", that's also one word. But "2" is more concise and directly answers the arithmetic expression.

The user is asking for a very simple arithmetic result. The simplest possible answer is "2". This is one word (or one token). I should not add any punctuation or explanation. Just "2".

Let me double-check: Is there any ambiguity? The user says "exactly one word". If I type "2", that's one character, but it represents a word (the number two). In the context of these instructions, a numeral is acceptable as a single-word response. It's the most direct answer.
