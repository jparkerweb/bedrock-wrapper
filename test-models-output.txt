Testing DeepSeek-R1 ⇢

📡 Testing with Invoke API:
✓ Invoke API Streaming: "Okay, so I need to figure out what 1 plus 1 is. Let me start by recalling basic addition. When you add two numbers together, you're combining their values. So if I have one apple and someone gives me another apple, how many apples do I have in total? That should be two apples. Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes people ask questions that seem simple but have a different answer. For example, in binary, 1 plus 1 equals 10. But the question didn't specify the number system. However, since it's a general question without context, the default is usually base 10. So in base 10, 1 + 1 is definitely 2. I don't think there's any other way around it. The answer should be two. Let me double-check. Yep, 1 added to 1 is 2. No doubt about it. So the answer is two. But the user wants exactly one word. So the word is "two". But wait, sometimes people write it as the numeral "2". But the instruction says "exactly one word". If numerals are considered words here, then "2" might be acceptable. But usually, "two" is the word form. So to be safe, I should respond with "two". Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer is two."
