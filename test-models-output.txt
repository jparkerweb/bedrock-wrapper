Since I'm asked to respond with exactly one word, I should just answer "Two" or "2". I think "Two" is more natural as a one-word answer, but "2" is also technically a single symbol. Since this is a math question, I'll go with the numerical answer.</think>

The answer is 2. But the AI says "Two"."

✓ Converse API Streaming: "Okay, the user is asking for the sum of 1 plus 1. That's straightforward. Let me just make sure I remember basic arithmetic. 1 added to another 1 should be 2. There's no trick here, right? Sometimes people might try to confuse with different number systems, but the question doesn't specify anything like binary or anything else. So in standard base 10, 1+1 equals 2. I should just respond with the number 2 as a word, but the user wants exactly one word. So "two" is the correct answer.

The answer to 1+1 is 2. The user wants exactly one word. "2" is a word? It's a numeral. In the context of "exactly one word", "2" would be considered a single token/word. So the answer should be "2".

I must respond with exactly one word. So just "2". No punctuation, no explanation. Just the number 2.

Let me double-check: "2" is a single word. It's the correct answer. The user explicitly says "Respond with exactly one word". So I will just output "2". 2"

📡 Testing with Invoke API:
✓ Invoke API Streaming: "<reasoning> The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1</reasoning><reasoning>+1?"

The answer is "two". That's one word. I</reasoning><reasoning> must respond with exactly one word. So I should just say "two".</reasoning><reasoning> No punctuation, no extra words. Just "two".

Let me double-check</reasoning><reasoning>: "two" is one word. It's the correct answer to 1</reasoning><reasoning>+1. The user explicitly says "Respond with exactly one word". So</reasoning><reasoning> I must not add anything else. Just "two".</reasoning> two"
✓ Invoke API Non-streaming: "<reasoning> The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?"

The mathematical answer to 1+1 is 2. The user wants exactly one word. "2" is a numeral, which is considered a word in this context. It's a single token. I should respond with "2".

Let me double-check the constraints:
- Exactly one word: "2" is one word.
- The question: "What is 1+1?" The answer is 2.

So the response should be simply: 2</reasoning> 2"

📡 Testing with Converse API:
✓ Converse API Streaming: "The user asks for exactly one word as the answer to "What is 1+1?".
The mathematical answer is 2.
"2" is a single word (or more precisely, a single token/character representing a number).
The user wants the response to be exactly one word.
So I should respond with "2".
Let me double-check: Is "2" considered a word? In the context of this question, it's the expected answer. It's a single token. It's not multiple words. It's concise. It fits the requirement.
The user is being a bit tricky by asking for "exactly one word" for a math question, but the answer "2" is indeed a single word (or numeral, which functions as a word in this context).
I will respond with "2". 2"

📡 Testing with Converse API:
✓ Converse API Streaming: "The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?" So they want a single word answer. The answer is "2". That's one word. So we respond with exactly "2". Ensure no extra punctuation? The instruction: "Respond with exactly one word". So we should output "2". Possibly no period. So just "2". Ensure no extra whitespace. So final answer: "2".
