✓ Invoke API Non-streaming: "<reasoning> The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?"

I must respond with exactly one word. The answer to 1+1 is 2. "2" is a single word (or token). It's a number, which is considered a word in this context. The instruction is very clear: "exactly one word". So I should just say "2".

Let me double-check: "2" is one word. It's the correct answer. The user wants exactly one word. So my response should be:

2

That's it. No extra punctuation, no explanation, just the single word "2".</reasoning> 2"

📡 Testing with Converse API:
✓ Converse API Streaming: "The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?"
The instruction is to respond with exactly one word.
The answer to 1+1 is 2.
"2" is a single word (or token/character). It's a number, which is considered a word in this context.
I must not add any extra words, punctuation, or explanation. Just the single word.
The word is "2".
Let me double-check: Is "2" considered a word? In the context of such questions, a number is typically accepted as a valid single-word answer. It's the most direct and accurate response.
The user wants exactly one word. "Two" would also be one word, but "2" is more direct for a mathematical question. However, "Two" is spelled out. Let me think about which is better.
The question is "What is 1+1?". The answer is the number 2. In English, this can be represented as "2" or "two". Both are single tokens.
"2" is a numeral. "Two" is a word.
The user asks for "exactly one word". "Two" is a word. "2" is a numeral, which might not be considered a "word" in the strictest linguistic sense, but in common usage for these types of puzzles, it's accepted.
However, to be safe and literal, "Two" is unambiguously a word.
Let me reconsider. The prompt is very simple. The simplest answer is "2". If I answer "Two", it's also one word.
Which is more likely to be what the user wants? The user is asking a mathematical question. The standard answer format is the numeral.
But the constraint is "exactly one word". This is a meta-constraint. The user is testing my ability to follow instructions precisely.
If I say "2", is that a "word"? In natural language processing, tokens are often separated by spaces. "2" would be a token. It's not a word in the dictionary sense, but it's a valid single-unit response.
If I say "Two", it's definitely a word.
Let me think about potential pitfalls.
- If I say "2.", that's two characters, but one token. It has punctuation. The instruction says "exactly one word". Punctuation might violate the spirit of it. Safer to avoid punctuation.
- If I say "Two", it's exactly one word. No punctuation. This seems to be the safest interpretation that strictly follows the instruction "one word".
- If I say "2", it's the most natural answer to the math question, and it's a single token. It's highly likely to be accepted.

Let's weigh the trade-offs.
- "2": Most natural answer to the math question. Might be debated if it's a "word". It's a numeral.
- "Two": Unambiguously a word. Slightly less natural for a math question, but still correct.

The user is emphasizing the format constraint: "Respond with exactly one word". This suggests the format is more important than the typical conventions of answering math questions. The instruction is a command about the response itself.
Therefore, I should prioritize fulfilling the "exactly one word" instruction in the most literal way possible.
"Two" is a word. It's exactly one word.
"2" is a numeral. While often acceptable, if we're being pedantic, it's not a word.

Let's go with "Two". It's safer regarding the explicit instruction.
Wait, let me reconsider again. In common parlance, "word" can mean a unit of language. A numeral like "2" functions as a word in a sentence. "I have 2 apples." Here "2" is a determiner/quantifier.
However, the most straightforward interpretation of "word" is a sequence of letters.
"Two" fits this perfectly"

📡 Testing with Converse API:
✓ Converse API Streaming: "The user asks: "Respond with exactly one word: What is 1+1?" So we need to respond with exactly one word. The answer is "2". So we must output exactly "2". No extra punctuation? The instruction: "Respond with exactly one word". So we should output "2". That is a single word. Should we include a period? That would be a second token? The instruction says exactly one word. Typically punctuation is allowed? But to be safe, just output "2". No extra spaces, no newline? Probably just "2". So final answer: "2".
