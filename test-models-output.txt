Testing Claude-3-7-Sonnet-Thinking ⇢
Streaming test passed for Claude-3-7-Sonnet-Thinking: "Two"
Non-streaming test passed for Claude-3-7-Sonnet-Thinking: "<think>The question asks for exactly one word that answers "What is 1+1?"

The answer to 1+1 is 2.

So I should respond with just the single word "two" or the numeral "2".

I think the most appropriate response is just the word "two" since this is a word rather than a numeral, and the instruction was to respond with exactly one word.</think>

Two"
